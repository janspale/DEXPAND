# DEXPAND
Optimised expanders for small-scale distributed energy systems - raw experimental data, turbine geometries, performance mapping.

![ORC expander measurement and testing in the laboratory](dexpand.png)

> DEXPAND project analyses potentials and feasibility of prospective expanders for organic Rankine cycles (ORC) based on impulse turbomachines and rotary vane expanders in power range of 1-50 kW... Geometries and experimental data including many off-design operation states will be summarised and published to boost industrial development as well as research on expanders in this field. 

This is a publc repository of the research project where expander geometries, experimental data and performance mapping will be published. The repository is open to the public and is intended to be used by the research community, industry and other stakeholders interested in the field of small-scale distributed energy systems and expanders for ORC.

## Expander geometries
Folder `geometries` contains CAD models (and/or drawings) of expanders used in the project. The models are available in various formats, including STEP, STL and native CAD formats. The models are intended to be used for further research and development of expanders for small-scale distributed energy systems.

## Experimental data
Folder `experimental_data` contains raw experimental data from the tests of expanders. The data are available in various formats, including CSV, XLSX and other formats. The data are published to boost industrial development as well as research on expanders in this field. Each subfolder contains data from a specific test, including the test conditions, measured data and other relevant information.
